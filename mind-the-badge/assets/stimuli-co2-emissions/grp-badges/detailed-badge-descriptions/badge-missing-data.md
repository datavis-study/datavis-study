Missing Data: Land-Use Emissions Not Included

The figures do not include CO2 emissions from changes in land use (LUC), such as deforestation or reforestation. As a result, totals shown here may under‑ or over‑represent overall carbon fluxes when compared to inventories that include LUC.

- Excluded sources: Deforestation, forest degradation, afforestation/reforestation, and other land-use changes.
- Interpretation: Use caution when comparing against datasets that include LUC, as scopes differ.
- Recommendation: If relevant to your analysis, consult complementary sources that report LUC emissions separately.
