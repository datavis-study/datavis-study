Geographically Filtered (Continent-Based)

This visualization is filtered by continent. Values shown reflect only the subset of data that belong to the selected continent(s), which may differ from global totals or other regions.

- Scope: Only entities within the chosen continent(s) are included.
- Interpretation: Comparisons to world values require caution, as coverage and context differ.
- Reproducibility: Apply the same continent filter(s) to replicate figures.

If multiple continents are selectable, the result depends on the current selection state.
