Compilation of the latest 2100 median warming projections from [UNEP](https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021), [CAT](https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/997/CAT_2021-11-09_Briefing_Global-Update_Glasgow2030CredibilityGap.pdf), [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021/scenario-trajectories-and-temperature-outcomes) and [CR](https://data.climateresource.com.au/ndc/20211109-ClimateResource-1-9C_to2-7C.pdf) as of 9 November 2021, compared to the assessed warming values for the five shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios highlighted in the recent [IPCC AR6 WG1](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/) report. Both central estimates and uncertainty ranges are shown. Note that the IEA current policy scenario (STEPS) is in-between policies in place today and 2030 commitments.
