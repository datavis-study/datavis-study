## On the next page you’ll see

* The task you’ll complete later (in the sidebar top left)
* An example response

## Do this:

1. Get familiar with the layout
2. Read the task, the visualization and the response
3. **Do not** copy the sample wording in later tasks—use your own words.

**Note:** This is just one example. There isn’t a single “right” answer—apply your own judgment.
