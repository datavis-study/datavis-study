**What you should know about this data:**
This data is based on territorial emissions, meaning the emissions produced within a country's borders, but not those from imported goods. For example, emissions from imported steel are counted in the country where the steel is produced. To learn more and look at emissions adjusted for trade, read our article: How do CO₂ emissions compare when we adjust for trade?
Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included in the data for any individual country or region. They are only counted in the global total.
