Fossil CO₂ emissions This refers to the carbon dioxide released when burning fossil fuels or from certain industrial activities.
Burning fossil fuels — coal, oil, and gas — produces CO₂ during transport (cars, trucks, planes), electricity generation, heating, and energy use in industry. This also includes flaring, which is the burning of extra gas during oil and gas extraction.
Some industrial processes also release CO₂. This happens especially in cement and steel production, where chemical reactions (unrelated to burning fuel) produce carbon dioxide.
These figures don't include CO₂ emissions from changes in land use, like deforestation or reforestation.
