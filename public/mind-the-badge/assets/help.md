## How to participate:

- Use a laptop or desktop with a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Find a quiet place and set aside uninterrupted time.
- Read instructions on each page and use the button in the sidebar to continue.
- Some questions are required. If Next is disabled, scroll to find unanswered items or error messages.
- Avoid using the browser Back/Forward or Refresh while in the study. Use the in‑app navigation only.
- A progress bar shows how far along you are. If you need to pause, leave this tab open to resume later on the same device and browser.

## If you have technical issues:

- First try reloading the page. If that doesn’t help, open the study in a private/incognito window.
- Disable ad blockers, privacy extensions, or VPNs that might block assets.
- Ensure cookies and local storage are enabled for this site.
- If the page looks stuck, check for required answers you may have missed.
- Try a different supported browser if problems persist.
- When contacting us, include a brief description, your browser/version, and a screenshot if possible.
