Scenario labels distinguish two families of futures shown in this chart:

- IPCC AR6 SSP pathways (e.g., SSP5‑8.5 → SSP1‑1.9), which are standardized radiative‑forcing scenarios used to explore possible climates under different socio‑economic and mitigation assumptions.
- Policy/pledge projections from UNEP, CAT, IEA, and Climate Resource (e.g., current policies, 2030 pledges, net‑zero + 2030 pledges), which reflect stated commitments and analyses as of Nov 2021.

Grouping and color encoding separate these families so readers do not directly compare like‑for‑like numbers across fundamentally different assumptions. Labels clarify that bars represent median expected warming by 2100 relative to the pre‑industrial (1850–1900) baseline, and that ranges indicate central uncertainty.
